# rock-paper-scissors

This is my attempt of the third official project in The Odin's Project's Foundations curriculum. I will be recreating the game "rock, paper, scissors" using JavaScript. The early versions of this project will executed in the browser's console, but will implement a graphical user interface (GUI) in the near future.
